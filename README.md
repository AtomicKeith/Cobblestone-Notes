# Cobblestone-Notes

This is an un-official project to help map-out all of the items, crops, tools, npcs, etc. for the Minecraft server <ins>Cobblestone</ins> in order to help new players. You can join the server at `cobblestone.minehut.gg`.

## How Do I See the Map?

To see the map you'll need 2 programs, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).  
GitHub Desktop allows you to easily download updates from the repository onto your computer, without cloning the entire thing over again.  
Obsidian is what actually processes this GitHub Repository, allowing you to see a visual map of the contents and their individual pages. Unfortunately there's no way to view files stored online, hence the need for cloning it locally.

## How to Contribute

At the moment I plan on accepting contributions after I finish mapping out <ins>The Barn</ins>. This is to allow me to fully set up standard mappings for all items to make sure things stay consistent. Applications will be in a to-be-made Discord server.
